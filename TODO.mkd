## Sydbox TODO list ##

  - Libification, compnerd started this in [libsydbox](http://github.com/alip/sydbox/tree/libsydbox) branch.

### Unit tests ###
  - We could always use more unit and/or program tests.
  - Move checks written in [check](http://check.sourceforge.net/) to
    [glib](http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/unstable/glib-Testing.html)
    so we can ditch the [dev-libs/check](http://git.exherbo.org/summer/packages/dev-libs/check/) dependency.

### Network support ###
  - Denying only non-local connections.
  - Denying by IP address.

### Porting ###
  - Port it to different architectures, currently we support:
    * [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86): stable.
    * [x86\_64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_64): stable.
    * [ia64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia64): new, needs testing.
    * [ppc64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ppc64): new, needs testing.

### Logo ###
  - We need a logo for sydbox. Ideas include:
    * The cover of
      [dark side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon),
      except with some representation of a box substituted for the prism. (spbecker)
    * The burning guy from
      [wish you were here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wish_You_Were_Here_%28Pink_Floyd_album%29)
      holding a box. (spbecker)
    * **Wish you were here** arguably fits better to the name. (arkanoid)
    * [Baby Lemonade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrett_%28album%29) in a box. (alip)
    * [Lucifer Sam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer_Sam), a
      [Siamese cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_%28cat%29) that looks like the devil in a box. (alip)
