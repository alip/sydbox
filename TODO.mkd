## Sydbox TODO list ##

  - Libification, compnerd started this in libsydbox branch.
  - Port it to different architectures. Currently we support x86, x86_64 and ia64.
  - Proper network support. This includes denying only non-local connections etc.
  - Write more tests. We could always use more unit and/or program tests.
