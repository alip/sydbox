## Sydbox TODO list

  - Libification, compnerd started this in [libsydbox](http://github.com/alip/sydbox/tree/libsydbox) branch.

### Unit tests
  - We could always use more unit and/or program tests.

### Network support
  - Network blacklisting.
  - Detection of `bind()` ports when the port argument is 0.
  - Sandbox `sendmsg()` calls, currently we sandbox `connect()`, `bind()` and `sendto()`.

    * [x86](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86): stable.
    * [x86\_64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_64): stable.
    * [ia64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ia64): new, needs testing.
