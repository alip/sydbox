## Sydbox TODO list ##

  - Libification, compnerd started this in [libsydbox](http://github.com/alip/sydbox/tree/libsydbox) branch.
  - Port it to different architectures. Currently we support x86, x86_64, ia64 and ppc64.
  - Proper network support. This includes denying only non-local connections etc.
  - Write more tests. We could always use more unit and/or program tests.

### PowerPC ###

  - This architecture support is rather new and needs testing.
