    In the sad town
    Cold iron hands clap
    The party of clowns outside
    Rain falls in gray far away
    Please, please, baby lemonade

    In the evening sun going down
    When the earth streams in, in the morning
    Send a cage through the post
    Make your name like a ghost
    Please, please, baby lemonade

    I'm screaming, I met you this way
    You're nice to me like ice
    In the clock they sent through a washing machine
    Come around, make it soon, so alone
    Please, please, baby lemonade

    In the sad town
    Cold iron hands clap
    The party of clowns outside
    Rain falls in gray far away
    Please, please, baby lemonade

    In the evening sun going down
    When the earth streams in, in the morning
    Send a cage through the post
    Make your name like a ghost
    Please, please, baby lemonade
