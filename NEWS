News for sydbox
===============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list of
every change, see git log.


0.1_rc1:
    * Don't die when ptrace() fails with EIO, fixes #213.
    * Don't barf if configuration file doesn't exist.
    * Fix segfaults due to using log functions in signal handler.

0.1_beta10:
    * Fix build failures due to bad packaging, iow i fail.

0.1_beta9:
    * Fix execve(2) and network sandboxing checks when path sandboxing is
      disabled.
    * Ported to IA64, now IA64 is a supported architecture. (thanks to Ingmar and ahf)
    * Support for tracing 32 bit binaries on x86_64 systems.

0.1_beta8:
    * Exit when eldest child exits and add a command line flag --wait-all to
      wait for all children before exiting.
    * Fix /proc/self substitution.
    * Add configuration file variable main.allow_proc_pid and allow /proc/PID
      depending on that variable. This defaults to true because allowing
      /proc/PID is required for some programs to work reliably.
    * Path sandboxing can now be disabled using the configuration file or
      --disable-sandbox-path command line option. Previously this was only
      possible using /dev/sydbox/{on,off} magic commands.
    * Configuration file changes, make sure to merge your configuration file.

0.1_beta7:
    * Fix magic stat problems on x86
    * Fix segfaults caused by wrong handling of the list of children.

0.1_beta6:
    * Implement proper execve(2) sandboxing instead of the ban_exec hack.
    * Add command line options --sandbox-exec and --sandbox--network.
    * Fix inheritance of sandbox data between children.

0.1_beta5:
    * Implement /dev/sydbox/{un,}ban_exec. paludis-sydbox branch makes use of
      these magic commands to ban execve() calls in metadata phase.
    * When shell_expand() returns empty string, it was added to the pathlist
      resulting every path prefix check to be allowed, this is now fixed.

0.1_beta4:
    * Use an lstat(2) wrapper which tries hard to avoid ENAMETOOLONG issues.
    * Handle /proc/self correctly when resolving paths.

0.1_beta3:
    * Fixed event handling and inheritance of sandbox data. Sydbox behaves
      correctly now when a child calls fork(), vfork() or clone().

0.1_beta2:
    * Canonicalize filenames by default. This was previously only done in
      paranoid mode. This makes sydbox stricter (expect more test
      suites to fail).

0.1_beta:
    * Fix bogus access violations. As an example sydbox would
      throw an access violation in a simple case like
      $ mkdir -p /var/tmp/paludis
      because of mkdir("/var", ...) being called.
      This is now fixed.
    * Use glib's key file format for configuration file. This kills the
      dependency on dev-libs/confuse. Being a crucial system tool we're
      trying to keep the dependencies as few as possible.
    * Many other small fixes.

0.1_alpha:
    * Initial public release
