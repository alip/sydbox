News for sydbox
===============

This file lists the major changes between versions. For a more detailed list of
every change, see git log.


0.1_beta5:
    * Implement /dev/sydbox/{un,}ban_exec. paludis-sydbox branch makes use of
      these magic commands to ban execve() calls in metadata phase.
    * When shell_expand() returns empty string, it was added to the pathlist
      resulting every path prefix check to be allowed, this is now fixed.

0.1_beta4:
    * Use an lstat(2) wrapper which tries hard to avoid ENAMETOOLONG issues.
    * Handle /proc/self correctly when resolving paths.

0.1_beta3:
    * Fixed event handling and inheritance of sandbox data. Sydbox behaves
      correctly now when a child calls fork(), vfork() or clone().

0.1_beta2:
    * Canonicalize filenames by default. This was previously only done in
      paranoid mode. This makes sydbox stricter (expect more test
      suites to fail).

0.1_beta:
    * Fix bogus access violations. As an example sydbox would
      throw an access violation in a simple case like
      $ mkdir -p /var/tmp/paludis
      because of mkdir("/var", ...) being called.
      This is now fixed.
    * Use glib's key file format for configuration file. This kills the
      dependency on dev-libs/confuse. Being a crucial system tool we're
      trying to keep the dependencies as few as possible.
    * Many other small fixes.

0.1_alpha:
    * Initial public release
