NAME
----
sydbox - ptrace based sandbox

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sydbox* ['OPTION'] -- command [args]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Sydbox is a sandboxing utility.

*Features*:::
- Ptrace based which means it can sandbox static binaries unliked *LD_PRELOAD*
  based sandbox utilities.
- Intercepts system calls and checks for allowed filesystem prefixes, denies them when checks fail.
- Basic support for disallowing network connections.

OPTIONS
-------
The ordering of option percedence is configuration file, environment variables,
command line parameters.

*-?, --help*::
    Show help options
*-c, --config*::
    Specify path to the configuration file
*-D, --dump*::
    Dump configuration and exit
*-L, --lock*::
    Disallow magic commands
*-C, --no-colour*::
    Disallow colouring of messages
*-p, --paranoid*::
    Enable paranoid mode (EXPERIMENTAL)
*-V, --version*::
    Print version information and exit

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
The behaviour of sydbox is affected by the following environment variables.

SANDBOX_WRITE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable specifies the paths that are allowed to be written to. It is
expected to be a colon delimited list of paths.

SANDBOX_PREDICT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable specifies the paths that are predicted to be written to. It is
expected to be a colon delimited list of paths.

SANDBOX_NET
~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable controls the behaviour of sydbox with regards to network access.
If it is set, sydbox will sandbox network connections.

SANDBOX_CONFIG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable specifies the configuration file to be used by sydbox. This is
equivalent to the -c option.

SANDBOX_NO_COLOUR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable controls the behaviour of sydbox with regards to colourized
output. If it is set, sydbox's output will not be coloured. This is equivalent
to the -C option.

SANDBOX_LOG
~~~~~~~~~~~
This variable specifies the log file to be used by sydbox. This is equivalent to
the -l option.

PARANOID MODE
-------------
When sydbox is run in paranoid mode, it attempts to ensure security of the
sandbox. For example, if a system call's path argument is a symlink, sydbox will
attempt to change it with the resolved path to prevent symlink races.

Many programmes are known to fail when run under sydbox with paranoid mode
enabled.

Sydbox is not considered to be a security tool without this mode enabled.  It
can still be used by package managers, such as paludis, to ensure that arbitrary
files are not written to. It is *NOT* meant to be used for protection against
malicious upstreams or packagers.
